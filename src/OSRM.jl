    # when building the JLLs, we set dont_dlopen=true, because Yggdrasil runs Julia 1.7,

    # a side effect of this is that the JLLs themselves don't autoload the libraries, so we have
    # to load them manually. Even though we don't use any functions from libosrm.so directly,
    # we have to dlopen it first so that it is available when we load libosrmjl.so - because
    # libosrm.so is not on the loadpath for libosrmjl.so. H/T Mos√© Giordano.
